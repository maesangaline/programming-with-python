# Asks the user to input the number of coins
# Perform a quick calculation to determine their value based on the coin type
penny = int(input('Enter the number of pennies: ')) * 1
nickel = int(input('Enter the number of nickels: ')) * 5
dime = int(input('Enter the number of dimes: ')) * 10
quarter = int(input('Enter the number of quarters: ')) * 25

# If over $1.00
if penny + nickel + dime + quarter > 100:
    print('The amount entered was more than one dollar.')
# If less than $1.00
elif penny + nickel + dime + quarter < 100:
    print('The amount entered was less than one dollar.')
# If equals $1.00
else:
    print ('You won! Congradulations')
