# Chapter 3
# Exercise 16

# Asks the user to input the year
year = int(input('Enter a year: '))

# Is the year divisible by 4 AND not divisible by 100 OR divisible by 400? Then it's a leap year.
if year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0):
    print('In ' + format(year) + ' February has 29 days, which is a leap year.')
# If not, it is not a leap year
else:
    print('In ' + format(year) + ' February has 28 days, which is not a leap year.')
